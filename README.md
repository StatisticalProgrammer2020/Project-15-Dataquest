# DQ R-Project 15: Predicting Car Prices
This is my fifteenth project in Dataquest towards my journey in R Programming.  This project aims to use machine learning in order to predict car prices. Specifically, we'll be implementing the k-nearest neighbhors algorithm to predict a car's market price based on various car characteristics. In this project, the following concepts are used to achieve the given problem:
- Evaluating Model Performance
- Multivariate K-Nearest Neighbors
- Cross Validation
- Hyperparameter Optimization
